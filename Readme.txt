DESCRIPTION

WPFGraph is a tool to create animations of graph algorithms using a 
WPF based 3D rendering engine. You can create a graph by adding nodes 
and edges to the UI simply by using your mouse. Then you can execute
a graph algorithm like Dijkstra on the created graph. Within the 
algorithm it is possible to flash nodes or edges or to move them 
around for a better visualization of what happens during the algorithm.
